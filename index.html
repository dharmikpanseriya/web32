        <h1>Rate Of Change Indicator</h1>
    </div>

    <p>The Rate Of Change (ROC) is a momentum-based technical indicator that measures the percentage change in price from one period to another. By doing this, the ROC offers insights into the speed of a security's price movement.</p>
    <h3>What it is and what it shows</h3>
    <p>The ROC is calculated by taking the difference between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago, divided by the price a certain number of periods ago. The result is multiplied by 100 to provide a percentage.</p>
    <p>Formula:</p>
    <p>ROC = [(Current Price - Price n periods ago) / (Price n periods ago)] * 100</p>
    <p>For example, if the current price of a stock is $110 and its price 10 days ago was $100, the ROC would be:ROC = [(110 - 100) / 100] * 100 = 10%</p>
    <p>This indicates that the stock's price has increased by 10% over the 10-day period.</p>
    <h3>How to trade it</h3>
    <h4>1.Zero Line Crossovers:</h4>
    <p>Buy when the ROC crosses above the zero line, indicating potential upward momentum.Sell or go short when the ROC crosses below the zero line, indicating potential downward momentum.Example: If an asset's ROC moves from -2% to 3%, crossing the zero line, it can be taken as a bullish signal.</p>
    <h4>2.Divergences:</h4>
    <p>Bullish divergence: When the asset's price makes lower lows, but the ROC makes higher lows.Bearish divergence: When the asset's price makes higher highs, but the ROC makes lower highs.Example: If an asset's price forms a new low, but the ROC forms a higher low, it suggests weakening downward momentum.</p>
    <h4>3.Overbought/Oversold:</h4>
    <p>While the ROC doesn't have fixed levels for overbought or oversold conditions, traders can establish these based on historical observations of where the ROC typically reverses.Example: If the ROC reaches a level it hasn't reached in a long time, it might indicate an extreme and a potential price reversal.</p>
    <h3>Limitations Of The ROC</h3>
    <p>1.Volatility: ROC can be very volatile, especially with volatile assets, leading to potential false signals.</p>
    <p>2.No Trend Insights: ROC focuses on momentum and doesn't offer insights into the direction of the longer-term trend.</p>
    <p>3.Subjectivity: The absence of standardized overbought/oversold levels can make interpretation subjective.</p>
